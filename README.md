# final-project-image

This algorithm is based on [Adaptative Thresholding using the integral image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/115HmedlQuSfRsah6hVSdbJGE1afNXR-0/view)

The goal is to create a binary representation of the image, classifying each pixel into one of two categories, such as "black" or "white". This is a common task in many image processing applications, and some computer graphics applications. 


## Installation
