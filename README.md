# final-project-image

This algorithm is based on [Adaptative Thresholding using the integral image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/115HmedlQuSfRsah6hVSdbJGE1afNXR-0/view)

The goal is to create a binary representation of the image, classifying each pixel into one of two categories, such as "black" or "white". This is a common task in many image processing applications, and some computer graphics applications. 


## Prerequisites
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
* [opencv-python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencv-python)
* [numpy](https://scipy.org/install.html)

## How to use
Make sure python3 and pip is installed. Then, install cv2 and numpy.

```bash
#install opencv-python
pip install cv2
#install numpy
pip install numpy
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar
import os
import numpy as np
import cv2
import argparse
import ntpath

```
